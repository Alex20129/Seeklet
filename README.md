# Description
**'Seeklet'** is an open-source search engine written in C++/Qt.
This project aims to make a truly decentralized, free and open-source search engine. Its core idea is to provide the general public with a P2P search service that is inherently resistant to censorship.
Every participant runs a small node on ordinary hardware; together we build an independent, privacy-first alternative to centralized corporate search services.
